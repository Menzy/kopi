## Development Strategy

### Testing Approach:
- Unit tests for each phase
- Integration testing between phases
- User testing after Phase 3 and Phase 5

### Risk Mitigation:
- Start with macOS (simpler permissions)
- Validate CloudKit sync early
- Test privacy features thoroughly
- Plan for macOS 16+ permission changes

### Success Metrics:
- Each phase delivers working functionality
- CloudKit sync reliability >99%
- User onboarding completion >80%
- App Store approval on first submission

### Next Steps:
1. Review and approve this phased approach
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Establish testing and review processes
